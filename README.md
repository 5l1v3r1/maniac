  Simple external cheat for <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania">osu!mania</a>.<br>
</p>

Please note that maniac is __currently being rewritten__ as it transitions into the 1.0.0 release, this branch reflects the state of the rewrite. As it is now in a usable state, release candidates (`v1.0.0-rcx`) will be provided -- I am grateful for bug reports and feedback.

## Usage

1. Download the latest build from the [releases tab](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac/releases).
2. Start osu, start playing any beatmap for a couple of seconds and then either exit or pause. (Doesn't matter which map or mode, you only have to do this once for every time you start osu.)
3. Open a terminal and run maniac (e.g. by dragging-and-dropping the executable onto `cmd.exe`).

Maniac will now automatically play any beatmap you open in osu.
