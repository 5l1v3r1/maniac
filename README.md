<p align="center">Cheating in osu!mania.</p>

A simple external cheat for the [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) 
mode of the game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/). __This branch contains version 1.x, which
 is the new default. [Looking for older versions?](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac/tags)__

## Usage

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac/releases
). (Executables with the `-debug` postfix are significantly slower)
2.
